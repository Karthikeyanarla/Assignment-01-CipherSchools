Welcome to the README file for the Flutter project that implements the frontend of a mobile app for the ciperschools website.

## Overview

This project is built with Flutter, a popular UI toolkit for building natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase.

The objective of this project is to replicate the design and user interface of the ciperschools website for a mobile app using Flutter widgets.

## Setup

To get started with this project, follow the steps below:

1. Install the latest version of Flutter by following the instructions on the official Flutter website: https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install
2. Clone this repository to your local machine using the command `git clone https://github.com/Karthikeyanarla/Assignment-01-CipherSchools`
3. Open the project in your preferred code editor or IDE (such as Visual Studio Code or Android Studio)
4. Run the command `flutter pub get` to install the project dependencies
5. Run the command `flutter run` to launch the app on an emulator or physical device

## Project Structure

The project structure follows the standard Flutter project structure, with the main code files located in the `lib` folder. Here is a brief overview of the key files and folders in the project:

- `lib/main.dart`: The entry point of the app, where the `MaterialApp` widget is defined.
- `lib/screens`: Contains the main screens of the app, each of which is implemented as a separate widget.
- `lib/widgets`: Contains reusable widgets that are used across multiple screens in the app.


## Dependencies

The project uses the following dependencies:


- `http`: A package for making HTTP requests.
- `url_launcher`: A package for launching URLs in the device's default browser.
- `flutter_face_pile`: A package for displaying face piles. 
- `flutter_rating_bar`: A package used for rating.
- `carousel_slider`: A package for carousel_display for different courses available.
- `slider_button`: A package for slider_button

All dependencies are listed in the `pubspec.yaml` file and are automatically installed when you run the `flutter pub get` command.

## Conclusion

Thank you for taking the time to read this README file. I hope this project serves as a useful reference for implementing the frontend of a mobile app using Flutter. If you have any questions or feedback, feel free to contact me.
